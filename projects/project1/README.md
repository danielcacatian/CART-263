### Artist Statement

For this Night at the Movies project, we had to recreate a movie scene using p5.js and some other libraries. But more importantly, it had to be interactive. If it wasn't, people could display a video of the movie scene. An obvious way to approach this would be to make a game about the movie, but I had a different idea in mind. I wanted the user behind the computer screen to be the main character of the movie. After figuring out my main approach, it was just about figuring what movie.

I ended up settling for the Matrix, and the scene I chose is where Neo first finds out about the Matrix from certain events. I wanted to capitalize on those events to make the user feel like they’re also discovering the Matrix for the very first time. Plus, Neo is a computer programmer, and we’re learning how to program, so it seemed fitting. To make this happen, I made the start of my program look and feel like it has nothing to do with the Matrix. I resorted to doing a questionnaire where the questions had obvious answers because they’re based on facts on our reality. The reasoning behind this is because the Matrix is a world built like our reality, except it only seems that way because the people living in it think that way. They restrict themselves by the natural laws that governed our real world, like gravity, for example. Towards the end, I want the user to finally understand that this project references the Matrix and the only way they can find the true ending is by deviating from the norm and believing that whatever they’re doing isn’t real. Although it is not exactly like in the movie, it takes a lot of inspiration from it that, without a doubt, the user will know what movie I’m referencing.

Of course, this is real life, but I hope to have the user receive some self-doubt that there is something off about the project then soon realizing the truth behind it.
